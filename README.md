# Marta - The Medical Assistant

## Project Overview

Marta - The Medical Assistant is an innovative project designed to leverage the capabilities of LlamaIndex, a powerful tool for managing and querying large datasets. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for medical data management, facilitating quick and secure access to critical information.

###  Project Components

- **Backend**: Built with FastAPI, the backend offers a robust and scalable API for data processing and management. FastAPI is known for its high performance and ability to handle large volumes of data, making it ideal for medical applications where speed and accuracy are crucial.

- **Frontend**: Developed with Next.js, the frontend uses the App Router for efficient routing and Zustand for state management. The user interface is designed with Shadcn UI and Radix UI components, styled with Tailwind CSS and Stylus for a modern and responsive design.

###  Key Technologies

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for production, providing hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles.
- **Shadcn UI & Radix UI**: Component libraries for building accessible, high-quality design systems and web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Stylus**: A preprocessor for CSS that allows for more efficient and organized styling.

## Getting Started
